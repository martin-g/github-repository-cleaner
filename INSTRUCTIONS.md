### Instructions for the Project

1. **Project Overview**:
   - This is a Rust-based project.
   - The project uses the following libraries:
     - `reqwest` for HTTP client functionality.
     - `tokio` for asynchronous runtime.
     - `serde_json` for JSON serialization and deserialization.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
     tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
     serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
     serde_json = "1.0"
     ```

3. **Async Runtime**:
   - Use the `#[tokio::main]` attribute for the main function to enable async execution.

4. **HTTP Requests**:
   - Use `reqwest` for making HTTP requests. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, but this project will use async.

5. **JSON Handling**:
   - Use `serde_json` for parsing and generating JSON.
   - Use `serde`'s `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` for struct serialization and deserialization.

6. **Code Structure**:
   - Organize the code into modules for better maintainability.
   - Example structure:
     ```
     src/
     ├── main.rs
     ├── http_client.rs
     ├── models.rs
     └── utils.rs
     ```

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Use `Result` and `?` for error propagation.
   - Leverage `reqwest`'s built-in error types for HTTP-related errors.

8. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for individual modules.
   - Use `tokio::test` for async test functions.

9. **Example Usage**:
   - Fetch data from an API using `reqwest`.
   - Parse the response JSON into a Rust struct using `serde_json`.

10. **Build and Run**:
    - Build the project: `cargo build`
    - Run the project: `cargo run`
